# 👋 Hey, I'm Unai Rada Dafonte

I'm a **Backend / Systems / DevOps Engineer** with over 4 years of experience designing and automating scalable infrastructure across cloud-native and hybrid environments. I'm passionate about enabling AI/ML workflows, building robust CI/CD pipelines, and pushing the limits of what reliable systems can do.

---

## 🚀 Current Focus

- Building resilient backend systems with **CI/CD** and **GitOps** workflows  
- Automating cloud infrastructure with **Terraform**, **Ansible**, and **Kubernetes**
- Develop and optimize **search systems** using tools like **Typesense**, **OpenSearch**, and **vector embeddings**
- Design robust APIs and backend services for real-time apps, chatbots, and e-commerce platforms  
- Empowering data science teams with scalable, secure **AI platforms**  
- Observability and monitoring across hybrid environments with **Prometheus**, **Grafana** and the **ELK stack**  
- Exploring search engineering, large language models (LLMs), and backend optimization
